### Heyo! I'm BloxxiKola and this tutorial is about Variables and Functions in ROBLOX Lua.

A **Variable** is a changable _value_ with a corresponding _identifier_, or nickname.

For example: `local identifier = value`

You'll notice I used **"local"** at the front of the text. This tells the computer that _you're_ creating the variable, it's not built into ROBLOX Lua.

Let's try setting a variable to something in the `Workspace`, the player's world. First, let's insert a part by right clicking anywhere and selecting "Insert Part":

We now have a Part in the Workspace. Now, right click that part in your `Explorer` tab, and hover over "Insert Object", and click "Script".
